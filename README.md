# Modular file based provisioning scripts

Vagrant supports many types of provisioners.  This project uses a simple file based approach.  Any files in `vagrant.d-enabled` with a filename matching `*.sh` will be executed after the VM starts up.

I have placed scripts for several applications that I commonly use in `vagrant.d-available` and most scripts that I most always have enabled are already symlinked in `vagrant.d-enabled`.
